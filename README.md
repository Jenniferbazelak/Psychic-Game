Press any key to begin. The object of the game is to guess the same letter that the computer has picked. If your guess is correct, YOU WIN! If you guess incorrectly, your failed attempts are recorded in "your guesses so far." You can only guess incorrectly up to 10 times. After 10 failed attempts you will lose and you can try again.
